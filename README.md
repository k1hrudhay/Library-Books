# Library-Books
Problem Statement:

At the school library, there is a need for a new library management system. One of the basic requirements of the system is to keep track of which books are in the library and which ones have been issued / checked-out by students.
In order to maintain this information, each book is given a unique identification number and there can be multiple copies of the same book. Every time a book is checked-out by a student, the count of available copies is reduced by one and the checkout counter is incremented. When the student returns the book, the count of available copies is incremented for that book.

This Python package hence helps to manage the Library Books system, maintaining the list and count of the books present in the Library.
